C# Fortnite External That Utilizes Kernel Driver

This is a POC (Proof Of Concept)

The actual driver (Virtualbox Exploit) is very detected on EAC & BE.

This also is a very "raw" external as its not a functional cheat. I plan to fully complete it with overlay and actual features. (might replace driver)
